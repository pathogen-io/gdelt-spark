    *
    * @param eventId            Globally unique identifier assigned to each event record that uniquely identifies it in the master dataset.
    *                           There is a large gap in the sequence between February 18, 2015 and February 19, 2015 with the switchover to GDELT 2.0
    * @param eventDay           Date the event took place
    * @param actor1Code
    * @param actor2Code
    * @param isRoot             The system codes every event found in an entire document, using an array of techniques to deference and link information together.
    *                           A number of previous projects such as the ICEWS initiative have found that events occurring in the lead paragraph of a document tend to be the most "important"
    *                           This flag can therefore be used as a proxy for the rough importance of an event to create subsets of the event stream.
    * @param cameoEventCode     This is the raw CAMEO action code describing the action that Actor1 performed upon Actor2.
    * @param cameoEventBaseCode CAMEO event codes are defined in a three-level taxonomy.
    *                           For events at level three in the taxonomy, this yields its level two leaf root node.
    *                           For example, code "0251" ("Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions") would yield an EventBaseCode of "025" ("Appeal to yield").
    *                           This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity.
    *                           For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.
    * @param cameoEventRootCode Similar to EventBaseCode, this defines the root-level category the event code falls under.
    *                           For example, code "0251" ("Appeal for easing of administrative sanctions") has a root code of "02" ("Appeal").
    *                           This makes it possible to aggregate events at various resolutions of specificity.
    *                           For events at levels two or one, this field will be set to EventCode.
    * @param quadClass          The entire CAMEO event taxonomy is ultimately organized under four primary classifications:
    *                           Verbal Cooperation, Material Cooperation, Verbal Conflict, and Material Conflict.
    *                           This field specifies this primary classification for the event type, allowing analysis at the highest level of aggregation.
    * @param goldstein          Each CAMEO event code is assigned a numeric score from -10 to +10, capturing the theoretical potential impact that type of event will have on the stability of a country.
    *                           This is known as the Goldstein Scale.
    *                           This field specifies the Goldstein score for each event type.
    *                           NOTE: this score is based on the type of event, not the specifics of the actual event record being recorded – thus two riots, one with 10 people and one with 10,000, will both receive the same Goldstein score.
    *                           This can be aggregated to various levels of time resolution to yield an approximation of the stability of a location over time.
    * @param numMentions        This is the total number of mentions of this event across all source documents during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.
    *                           Multiple references to an event within a single document also contribute to this count.
    *                           This can be used as a method of assessing the "importance" of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant.
    *                           The total universe of source documents and the density of events within them vary over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.
    *                           This field is actually a composite score of the total number of raw mentions and the number of mentions extracted from reprocessed versions of each article (see the discussion for the Mentions table).
    * @param numSources         This is the total number of information sources containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.
    *                           This can be used as a method of assessing the "importance" of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant.
    *                           The total universe of sources varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.
    * @param numArticles        This is the total number of source documents containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.
    *                           This can be used as a method of assessing the “importance” of an event: the more discussion of that event, the more likely it is to be significant.
    *                           The total universe of source documents varies over time, so it is recommended that this field be normalized by the average or other measure of the universe of events during the time period of interest.
    * @param avgTone            This is the average “tone” of all documents containing one or more mentions of this event during the 15 minute update in which it was first seen.
    *                           The score ranges from -100 (extremely negative) to +100 (extremely positive).
    *                           Common values range between -10 and +10, with 0 indicating neutral.
    *                           This can be used as a method of filtering the “context” of events as a subtle measure of the importance of an event and as a proxy for the “impact” of that event.
    *                           For example, a riot event with a slightly negative average tone is likely to have been a minor occurrence, whereas if it had an extremely negative average tone, it suggests a far more serious occurrence.
    *                           A riot with a positive score likely suggests a very minor occurrence described in the context of a more positive narrative (such as a report of an attack occurring in a discussion of improving conditions on the ground in a country and how the number of attacks per day has been greatly reduced).
    * @param actor1Geo
    * @param actor2Geo
    * @param eventGeo

    * @param sourceUrl          This field records the URL or citation of the first news report it found this event in.
    *                           In most cases this is the first report it saw the article in, but due to the timing and flow of news reports through the processing pipeline, this may not always be the very first report, but is at least in the first few reports.

    *                          This can be used similarly to the CharOffset fields below, but reports the event’s location in the article in terms of sentences instead of characters, which is more amenable to certain measures of the "importance" of an event’s positioning within an article.
    * @param actor1CharOffset  The location within the article (in terms of English characters) where Actor1 was found.
    *                          This can be used in combination with the GKG or other analysis to identify further characteristics and attributes of the actor.

    * @param inRawText         This records whether the event was found in the original unaltered raw article text (a value of 1) or whether advanced natural language processing algorithms were required to synthesize and rewrite the article text to identify the event (a value of 0).
    *                          See the discussion on the Confidence field below for more details.
    *                          Mentions with a value of “1” in this field likely represent strong detail-rich references to an event.
